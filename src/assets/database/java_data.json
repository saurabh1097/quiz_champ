Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.

Abstract classes are used to define common behavior and structure for subclasses, while interfaces define a contract for classes to implement. Abstract classes can have both abstract (without implementation) and concrete methods, while interfaces can only have abstract methods. Classes can implement multiple interfaces but can only inherit from one abstract class.

        "answerExplanation": "Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be saved to a file or sent over the network. By marking a member variable as 'transient', you are telling the Java serialization mechanism to skip that variable when serializing the object. This can be useful for variables that do not need to be saved or for variables that contain sensitive information that should not be serialized."

        "answerExplanation": "The Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, provides a powerful and flexible way to process collections of objects. Streams allow you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, sorting, and aggregating on collections in a declarative way. This can lead to more concise and readable code compared to traditional iterative approaches. Streams also support parallel processing, which can improve performance for large collections by leveraging multi-core processors. By using streams, you can write code that is more expressive, easier to understand, and potentially more efficient."

The JVM translates the bytecode into machine-specific instructions, allowing Java programs to run on any platform that has a JVM implementation. This approach abstracts the underlying platform details, making Java programs highly portable."

They can be called directly on the class without the need to create an instance. Instance methods, on the other hand, belong to a specific instance of the class and can only be called on that instance. Static methods are often used for utility functions that are not tied to a specific instance, while instance methods are used for operations that depend on the state of a specific instance."

They define a single abstract method that must be implemented by any implementing class or lambda expression. Functional interfaces can also contain default methods, which provide default implementations for methods other than the single abstract method. Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement the abstract method of a functional interface, making it easier to work with functional interfaces in Java."

It is not guaranteed to be called promptly or at all by the garbage collector. The 'close' method, on the other hand, is typically used to release resources held by an object and should be called explicitly by the programmer when the resources are no longer needed.

A deep copy is useful when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object and its nested objects.

This is useful when you want to create a new object that is a deep copy of an existing object, with all nested objects also copied. A shallow copy, on the other hand, creates a new object and copies only the references to nested objects, so the copied object shares the same nested objects with the original object.

The 'strictfp' keyword in Java is used to ensure that floating-point calculations produce the same result across all platforms by enforcing strict rules for floating-point arithmetic. When a class or method is declared with the 'strictfp' keyword, all floating-point calculations within that class or method are performed using strict rules, ensuring consistent results across different platforms. This can be important in applications where precise and consistent floating-point calculations are required, such as in financial or scientific applications."
